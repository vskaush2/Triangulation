# Triangulation
This project describes a generic algorithm to triangulate an n-dimensional polytope. This algorithm is implemented both in Python and Mathematica. 

To run the Python Jupyter Notebook:

- Download Project from Git.
- Open Command Prompt/Terminal and change directory to the Project Folder.
- Create a New Virtual Environment running the latest version of Python.
- Type "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" on Command Prompt/Terminal to install all the project requirements and dependencies.
- Type "jupyter notebook" Command Prompt/Terminal
- Open the "TriangulationDemo.ipynb" file on the Jupyter Server.
- Run each code cell.

To run the Mathematica Notebook:
- Install the latest version of Mathematica.
- Open the "TriangulationDemo.nb" file in Mathematica.
- Run each code cell.
